# Real-Time-Face-Counting-system
This project presents an automated face counting system based on estimating the number of faces visible in front of a camera.   The role of a video camera plays a greatly significant role in this project. This artificial intelligence system was made in order to reduce the lack of accuracy when counting the number of people in a location such as universities, hospitals or any other administrative sectors. This program logic can further be used in other applications, such as automatic temperature control which depends on the number of persons in a room. The prime purpose of this system is to output the number of people instantly and more accurately using a camera and image processing techniques. This system is done through the implementation of the viola jones algorithm.
